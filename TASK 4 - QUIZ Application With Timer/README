üöÄ **Step 1: Define the Question Class**
- The `Question` class holds information about each quiz question, including the question itself, multiple-choice options, and the index of the correct answer.

üß© **Step 2: Create the Quiz_Application Class**
- The `Quiz_Application` class manages the quiz flow, such as displaying questions, implementing timers, handling user answers, and calculating scores.
- It uses a list of `Question` objects to store the quiz questions.
- The `startQuiz_Application` method begins the quiz by displaying the first question.

‚è±Ô∏è **Step 3: Timer Implementation**
- The `startTimer` method uses a `Timer` object to schedule a task that runs after a specified time limit (30 seconds in this case).
- When the timer runs out, it moves to the next question automatically.

üìù **Step 4: Display and Get User Answer**
- `displayNextQuestion` shows the current question and options to the user.
- `getUserAnswer` reads the user's input (selected option) using a `Scanner`.

‚úîÔ∏è **Step 5: Check Answer and Score Calculation**
- `checkAnswer` compares the user's answer to the correct answer and updates the score accordingly.
- If the user's answer is correct, it adds one to the score.
- If the user's answer is incorrect, it displays the correct answer.

üèÅ **Step 6: End Quiz and Display Result**
- `endQuiz_Application` stops the timer, prints a message indicating the end of the quiz, and displays the user's final score out of the total number of questions.

‚ú® **Step 7: Main Class**
- The `Main` class creates a list of questions and initializes the `Quiz_Application` class to start the quiz.

Overall, this code implements a simple quiz application in Java that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions within a time limit and provides feedback on their performance at the end.
